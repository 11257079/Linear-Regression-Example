Linear Regression Example:
Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of Linear Regression to predict PM2.5 (Particulate Matter) levels for the next day (PM2.5_tomorrow) based on historical PM2.5 data. The dataset used in this example is related to air quality forecasting, making it a useful case study in environmental data analysis.

Linear Regression is a fundamental Machine Learning algorithm that models the relationship between an independent variable (PM2.5) and a dependent variable (PM2.5_tomorrow) to make predictions.

Understanding Linear Regression
Linear Regression follows the equation:

𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑏

Where:

y = Dependent variable (PM2.5_tomorrow)
x = Independent variable (PM2.5)
m = Slope (rate of change of y with respect to x)
b = Intercept (the value of y when x = 0)
The goal is to find the best-fitting slope and intercept that minimize the error between actual and predicted values.

Why Use Linear Regression?
✔ Predicting Trends: Helps understand how today's PM2.5 levels impact air quality tomorrow.
✔ Simplicity & Interpretability: Easy to implement and interpret.
✔ Foundation for Advanced Models: Forms the basis for more complex models like Multiple Linear Regression and Neural Networks.
✔ Feature Relationships: Provides insights into how different variables are correlated.

Applications of Linear Regression in Machine Learning
📌 Weather Forecasting – Predicting air pollution levels, temperature changes
📌 Stock Market Analysis – Predicting stock prices based on historical data
📌 Healthcare – Predicting disease risks based on environmental/lifestyle factors
📌 Economics – Forecasting GDP growth, inflation trends

Although Linear Regression is simple and powerful, real-world applications often require:

Polynomial Regression (for capturing non-linear relationships)
Multiple Linear Regression (if multiple variables impact predictions)
Neural Networks (for complex, high-dimensional data)
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression for air pollution forecasting. It provides valuable insights into the relationship between PM2.5 levels over time and how statistical models can be used to make predictions.

💡 Future improvements: Enhance the model by incorporating additional features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed for better predictive performance.
